# RangeError in Dart's reduce method with empty list

This example demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce` method in Dart with an empty list.  The `reduce` method requires at least one element in the list to operate correctly; otherwise, it throws a `RangeError`. This repository provides a simple illustration of the error and a solution to handle such cases gracefully.
